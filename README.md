# Secret-Santa
A short program which randomly assigns a name to each person entered into the program
Breif outline:
Enter the names and emails of people to participate in a secret santa, one by one. The user has the option to edit and delete existing entries.
It is worth noting that the email's main purpose is to act as a primary identifier, since people may have identical names. Another point worth noting is that the program assumes that the user is an admin and will not be participating in the secret santa.
